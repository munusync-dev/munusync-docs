# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying who you are before you can access a system or service. It ensures that only authorized users can log in and use protected resources.

## Key Concepts

- **Authentication**: Confirming your identity (e.g., username and password).
- **Authorization**: Determining what you are allowed to do after you are authenticated.

## How Authentication Works

1. **User provides credentials**  
   You enter your username and password, or use another method like a fingerprint or face scan.

2. **System verifies credentials**  
   The system checks if what you entered matches the stored data.

3. **Access granted or denied**
   - If the credentials match, you’re authenticated and allowed access.
   - If not, access is denied and you may be asked to try again.

## Example

Imagine you want to access a locked room.

- You need a special **key**—like a password—that only you have.
- When you try to access the room, it checks if your key is correct.
- If it is, you get access and the door opens.
- If not, access is denied and the door stays locked.

Authentication works the same way—it keeps things safe by letting only the right people access them.

## How Systems Store and Protect Credentials

- Passwords are usually stored as **hashed** values, meaning they are transformed into a secret code that can’t easily be reversed.
- When you log in, your password is hashed and compared with the stored hash.
- This protects your password even if the database is leaked.

## Why Authentication is Important

- Protects your personal data and privacy.
- Prevents unauthorized access to your accounts.
- Helps maintain trust in online services.
