# Git & GitHub

Git is a tool that helps you track changes in your code—like a time machine for your project. You can go back, see what changed, who changed it, and why.

GitHub is a platform where you can store your Git projects online. It lets you:

- Share code with others
- Work with teammates
- Back up your work
- Review and manage changes using pull requests
